Release notes
=============
This simple package is  a prototype containing a single client Method with minor changes to Document ItemType, Life Cycle and Form in the Fixes folder. A property named primary_file is added to Document, so that Files appear directly in main and relationship grids, following the CAD pattern. The 'Open in MS365' button opens a link to the online file. The Toggle button is intended to automate manual steps, not implemented yet. The prototype is intended for exploring uses of MS365 in conjunction with Innovator.
